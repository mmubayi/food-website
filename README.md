# food website - vegetarian in HK 

A simple website showing restaurant recommendations in Hong Kong for vegetarians with:
- 3 interlinked pages
- external CSS stylesheet 

---

This project was created using HTML and CSS for my Human Computer Interaction class. 

Currently, only Wellesley students can view the website [here](http://cs.wellesley.edu/~mmubayi/CS220/hw1.html).
Working on this! 

Planning to: 
- add more recommendations
- create more categories of cuisines
