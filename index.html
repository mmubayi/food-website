    <p> Here I have put together a selection of restaurants I love to eat at

    Hong Kong is currently the hottest place for mock-meat products, so there 
    are plenty of innovative dishes to try. However, if you don't enjoy meat-like
    flavours and/or textures, this might be something to watch out for. </p>
